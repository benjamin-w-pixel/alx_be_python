# Define the two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Calculate the difference (number1 - number2)
difference_result = number1 - number2

# Calculate the product
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results in the specified format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")
#output
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50

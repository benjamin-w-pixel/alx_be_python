# Assign specific values to two variables: number1 and number2.
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
# Calculate the sum
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Calculate the difference (by subtracting number2 from number1)
difference_result = number1 - number2

# Calculate the product
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results of each operation in the format:
# [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].
